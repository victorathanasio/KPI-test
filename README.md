# Welcome to the KPI-intelligence Demo !

# Stage 1: REST API

All the functionalities of the REST API are under the module REST_API and they where implemented using Flask.

# Stage 2: Web application

This stage was implemented using the library Dash.
The table in the Home Screen is scrollable from left to write, and up and down. It's also editable (So it acts as an endpoint,  and you can submit your changes using the button below the table itself) and it's has built-in filters.

To access a page with all the details of a given investment, you just select it in the table (The cell will turn red) and use the button bellow the table.

# Bonus stages

The endpoint in already working from the previous stage

The application can be found in this link (https://kpi-demo0.herokuapp.com/)

Due to the restrained time, here (http://jwallet.ml) you have another application that I developed during a hackaton with some very cool graphs (they are all interactive, do not hesitate in clicking in the first level of the pie-chart)

# Runing the project

After installing all the requirements (using the requirements.txt), you can simply use python app.py and it will run in your localhost.
